 🧩 Sudoku Solver - Internship Task 03

This project is part of the *SkillCraft Technology Internship*.
It solves a standard *9x9 Sudoku puzzle* using *Python and the backtracking algorithm*. The program automatically fills in the missing values (represented as 0) while following Sudoku rules.

## ✅ What I Learned

- Applying *recursive backtracking* in Python
- Working with *2D lists (matrices)*
- Designing logical steps to solve constraint-based problems
- Writing clean and readable code

## 📌 Tech Stack

- Python (Core Language)
- VS Code (Editor)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. 0 represents empty cells.
2. The algorithm recursively tries valid numbers.
3. If the board violates Sudoku rules, it backtracks.
4. Once the board is solved, it prints the result.


## 📂 File

- sudoku.py – Main Python file containing the full logic

## 🔢 Sample Sudoku Input

```python
board = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
 ]
